# hello-world
George's first GitHub project
Well, this is where I'm supposed to write something about myself. I'm a cat called Coco and my fur is shiny black. I love food and attention, but like to be on my own as well. I sleep at least half of the day and like to scream like a pig, uh, sorry, a cat, when I want something. My 'parents' love me though. They are so stupid, they can't even catch a mouse! And terribly slow... So Long, Coco.
